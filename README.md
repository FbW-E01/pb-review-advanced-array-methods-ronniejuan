# Review - Advanced array methods

NOTE! Pay close attention to creating code with good and consistent code style.

Use advanced array methods for all of these (forEach, map, etc.). You might have to search for an appropriate method to use on MDN.

1. Create an array with 10 objects, each of them should have a "name" property and a "URL" property and a "number" property.
2. Then based on the array, create a new array that contains just the names.
3. Go through the array and check each individual URL property - if the URL starts with "http", print the URL. Otherwise, print "Invalid URL for" and the value of the name property.
4. Sort the array based on the "number" property to a random order.
5. Sort the array based on the "number" property, with the lowest number first.
6. Sort the array based on the "number" property, with the highest number first.
7. Based on the array, create a string with all of the names of the people in the array separated by a comma and then replace the last comma with the string `" and "`.
